I've spent 3 years building web, desktop, and mobile applications.

I have mostly delivered software solutions by myself, but I have worked as a member of a small team before.

## Previously at [Codepilot](https://www.codepilot.com/)

- Built and maintained software for TheNobo
  - Backend Rest API (Express, NodeJS, MongoDb)
  - Client-facing web app at [thenobo.com](https://thenobo.com) (SvelteKit)
  - Admin panel for the site (SvelteKit)
  - TheNobo IOS app, of which I was the sole developer (SvelteKit, Capacitor)

## Projects I Freelanced

- Singlehandedly built cccdenton.org (Svelte)

- Coordinated with the owner of [DMT System](https://dmt-system.com/) to make improvements to the system and one of it's crucial dependencies, a live-syncing, JSON database.
