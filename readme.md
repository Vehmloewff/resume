# Elijah Mooring

I've spent 4+ years building web, desktop, and native mobile applications.

I have delivered complete software solutions by myself, worked as a member of a small team, and, most recently, worked as a member of a
large team.

I am capable of working with big data, and I am competent with databases and servers, but I love building sleek user interfaces, especially
in the form of native mobile and desktop applications. I love the fast pace and inherit risk of small companies, and would far rather focus
every ounce of my energy into engineering an efficient system than to simply do an easy job.
